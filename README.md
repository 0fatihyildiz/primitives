## Thanks

Thanks to [@radix_ui] for the inspiration and the great work they've done with [Radix Primitives](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/primitives/introduction). We proceed through the initial stages of many codes by looking at them.

Thanks to Johnson Chu [@johnsoncodehk]. Supported me in many issues that I was stuck in Typescript.
Thanks to Daniel Roe [@danielroe]. Nuxt has helped me in many areas so far.
